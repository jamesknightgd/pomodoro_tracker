# Overview
This is a time tracking web based application that allows me to track time on a pomodoro basis. Each time the focus of the pomodoro is changed or the pomodoro finishes it logs to the backend a record of the work completed. This work is aggregated to display daily, weekly, and monthly time spent working.
